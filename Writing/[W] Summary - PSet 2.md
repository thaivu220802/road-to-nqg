# Problem Set 2 – Beginners

## Problem 1

​	Many of my colleagues will disagree, but I believe that the time is right to legalize marijuana. Yes, this is a hot-button issue; however, there are good reasons why the growing and selling of marijuana should no longer be a criminal offense in the United States.

​	First, the federal government needs money. A lot of money! The federal deficit is now running into the trillions. Where is the tax money going to come from to pay off this massive debt? Marijuana. According to Business Week Magazine, “if the cost of retailing and distributing marijuana is the same for cigarettes, then the taxes from marijuana would be approximately $40 to $100 billion per year.” As you can see, marijuana would be an excellent source of tax revenue to help pay off the national debt.

​	A new source of tax revenue is not the only benefit of legalizing marijuana. Once marijuana is legalized, the crime rate will dramatically drop. By reducing marijuana related-crimes, state and national police agencies, for example, will be able to focus their limited resources on other crimes such as border security and terrorism. Let’s face it, the so-called “War on Drugs” has been a dismal failure. Isn’t it time to wake up to the fact that marijuana is here to stay?

​	Finally, there is the issue of choice. If I have the right to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, why shouldn’t I have the right to smoke marijuana? The Constitution clearly states that every American has the right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” According to the Constitution, I have the right to enjoy marijuana just like many enjoy alcohol and tobacco. And if marijuana kills me, just like alcohol and tobacco kill millions every year, that is my right and my choice too. By legalizing marijuana, this double standard will end.
