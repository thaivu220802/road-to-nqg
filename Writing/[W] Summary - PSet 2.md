# Problem Set 2 – Beginners

## Problem 1

Many of my colleagues will disagree, but I believe that the time is right to legalize marijuana. Yes, this is a hot-button issue; however, there are good reasons why the growing and selling of marijuana should no longer be a criminal offense in the United States.

First, the federal government needs money. A lot of money! The federal deficit is now running into the trillions. Where is the tax money going to come from to pay off this massive debt? Marijuana. According to Business Week Magazine, “if the cost of retailing and distributing marijuana is the same for cigarettes, then the taxes from marijuana would be approximately $40 to $100 billion per year.” As you can see, marijuana would be an excellent source of tax revenue to help pay off the national debt.

A new source of tax revenue is not the only benefit of legalizing marijuana. Once marijuana is legalized, the crime rate will dramatically drop. By reducing marijuana related-crimes, state and national police agencies, for example, will be able to focus their limited resources on other crimes such as border security and terrorism. Let’s face it, the so-called “War on Drugs” has been a dismal failure. Isn’t it time to wake up to the fact that marijuana is here to stay?

Finally, there is the issue of choice. If I have the right to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, why shouldn’t I have the right to smoke marijuana? The Constitution clearly states that every American has the right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” According to the Constitution, I have the right to enjoy marijuana just like many enjoy alcohol and tobacco. And if marijuana kills me, just like alcohol and tobacco kill millions every year, that is my right and my choice too. By legalizing marijuana, this double standard will end.

## Problem 2

Over the past few years, a new debate has emerged over how universities should concentrate their faculty's work. Many universities have begun shifting their focus away from research and toward better teaching methods. However, a number of reasons exist which suggest that this research is essential for universities to function properly.

One of the most important considerations for any college is its ranking among other institutions. A higher ranking benefits a university by drawing in more students. Most ranking systems put an emphasis on research work done by the faculty. Without an adequate base of research and published work, it is unlikely that a university will gain high marks in university ran kings.

Another benefit of focusing on research is that more faculties are likely to gain wider recognition. “Public intellectuals” -famous professors whose work has been recognized by the public at large- do a great deal to increase a university's prestige. Public intellectuals draw in more students and attract funding for the college. Without a focus on research, it is less likely that a university will produce a public intellectual.

Besides public appearance for a university, a focus on research can also directly benefit the students that attend the university. Professors that do more research in their field tend to have a better grasp of their subject and are more informed. This results in a better education for the students learning under them.

These considerations make it clear how important it is for colleges to focus on research. Choosing to focus on research not only improves the university's standing, but also ensures that the students attending get only the very best education.

## Problem 3

In the late eighteenth century, just after the revolution, a young America was looking for heroes it could call its own. They found one in Christopher Columbus. By sailing to the New World, Columbus left the old world behind, a world dominated by kings and nobles who controlled the land. By leaving the old in search of the new, Columbus symbolized America’s determination to break free of Britain and King George the Third and establish a new republic free of old world tyranny and enslavement.

Later, in the early nineteenth century, Americans viewed Columbus as the symbol of progress. Columbus was seen as a free man, a pioneer seeking new lands and new fortunes, a fearless adventurer much like the tens of thousands of Americans streaming west, risking their lives seeking fortune in new, unexplored territories west of the Mississippi. Americans were indeed bold and courageous. They liked their heroes the same way. Columbus fit the mold perfectly.

America of today, much like America of the past, is a country of contrasts and fragmentation. Political parties and religions proclaim their individual messages while regional boundaries divide us between north and south, east and west. Yet what brings us together as Americans is the name Christopher Columbus. Now, and in the past, we see in Columbus a man who embodies the spirit of freedom in which the right to “pursue life, liberty and happiness” is alive and well.

Now you can see why Americans consider Columbus to be one of our nation’s founding fathers, right up there with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Next Columbus Day, spend some time thinking about what Christopher Columbus means to America.

## Problem 4

A rising trend in education is online schools. Google “online schools” and you will get thousands of hits with schools offering every type of diploma and degree. But is an online education all it’s cracked up to be? Let the facts speak for themselves.

One of the big attractions of enrolling in an online school is convenience. However, many distance learners fall into the trap of thinking that they can fit an online course into their schedules. Just log on after work or on the weekend, and the homework gets done. If only it were so easy. A flexible schedule takes a lot of discipline, especially if you’re a working parent with a family to look after. In fact, the dropout rate for e-courses is very high. A report in the Chronicle of Higher Education found that “dropout rates range from 20-50% for distance learners as compared to 10-20% for their face-to-face counterparts.” Obviously, flexibility is not always a good thing.

Another issue is credibility. Think about it: Do you want a degree from an internet school nobody’s heard of, or do you want a degree from a brick-and- mortar university? Many students still want the name of an established academic institution on their resume. One unfortunate student, however, enrolled in an online school only to graduate and learn that the school had a bad reputation among Human Resource professionals. Who looks at your resume first? The people in Human Resources.

Then there is the issue of personal interaction. Part of an on-campus education is to meet face-to-face with your professors and peers. Such interaction is a vital part of the educational process yet it has been eliminated with the rise of e-courses. If you are the type of student who needs regular, face-to-face student-teacher interaction, then an e-course would not be a wise investment.
